                    You are now fully obligated to sit here and read an excerpt from a high-fantasy story I've been
                    planning to write. <br>
                    It's my gateway back to creative writing and push me away from writer's block. <br>
                    So, go on. Read.

                        "I was born into world fighting. <i>Struggling</i> for my life. I've not once heard my mother's
                        voice before; she
                        died the moment I came out of her womb. My father? Don't got one." The older adventurer spoke
                        with pure spite. For
                        whom, I wouldn't know, but I held my breath for he continued, "From then on, there was not one
                        moment where I can
                        simply stop and breathe and live my life as any parent would wish their child to do so. Then
                        again, parents are gone.
                        Forever and ever."<br> <br>

                        He paused in his recollection, stopping to inspect his blade before sheathing his sword. <br>
                        <br>

                        I feel myself tensed as I watched the man become sullen. "Or so I thought... until I met
                        <i>them</i>. The love of
                        my life." <br> <br>

                        I couldn't help but asked, near choking on my words, "What... what happened?" <br> <br>

                        The Diamond-ranked adventurer blinked a drop of tears away before turning to stare into the
                        campfire. "We needed income... and
                        becoming ratcatchers or going into the mines wasn't going pay us enough. So I volunteered to
                        become an adventurer. It
                        was supposed to be simple... but then the riches and recognition got to me; it inflated my ego.
                        My hubris, my folly.
                        If you know who I am, then I don't need to regale you the legends and tales. Just know... none
                        of it was worth the pain
                        of losing my love. They... moved on. I don't blame them. What would you do when your lover gave
                        you empty promises to
                        return and share their rewards, only to know they're enjoying it all without you? It has been...
                        ten years? Over that
                        time, last I heard and remembered, they gotten with another man, a fancy manor, and a set of
                        children. And here I am
                        enjoying life without my reason to <i>live</i>." <br> <br>

                        The adventurer looked back up to me as my face reflected off his lost, haunted eyes and gave
                        me—and what I know now—his
                        fakest smile of content. "Remember this, rookie: Nothing hurts more in the world than a life
                        without meaning. Fifteen years ago, I became the
                        youngest and only adventurer to achieve the highest ranking since the Guild Master and the
                        strongest man since the Age of Dawn ended for our
                        home. But at the end of it all? I'm simply a walking corpse seeking his grave. Not for atonement
                        or some other form of punishment for
                        myself. No, I'm going on these high-class quests because I just don't care anymore. And I'll do
                        it the way I was born into the world.
                        Fighting. Struggling for my life."
